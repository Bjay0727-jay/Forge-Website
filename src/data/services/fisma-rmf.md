## Expert FISMA & RMF Compliance Services

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act requires all federal agencies and their contractors to implement information security programs based on the NIST Risk Management Framework. Forge Cyber Defense provides end-to-end RMF implementation services that align with agency-specific requirements.

### The Six Steps of RMF

Our team guides organizations through each step of the NIST Risk Management Framework:

1. **Categorize** — Determine system impact levels using FIPS 199 criteria
2. **Select** — Choose and tailor the appropriate security control baseline
3. **Implement** — Deploy and configure security controls
4. **Assess** — Evaluate control effectiveness through testing
5. **Authorize** — Compile ATO package for authorizing official decision
6. **Monitor** — Maintain ongoing security posture through continuous monitoring

### Agency-Specific Experience

Our consultants have supported RMF implementations across numerous federal agencies, understanding the unique requirements and interpretations each agency brings to the framework. We work within your agency's existing processes and toolsets.

### ISSO as a Service

For organizations that need ongoing compliance management without hiring full-time staff, our ISSO-as-a-Service offering provides dedicated security professionals who manage your system's security posture, POA&Ms, and continuous monitoring deliverables.
