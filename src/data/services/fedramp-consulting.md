## Proven FedRAMP Authorization Expertise

Forge Cyber Defense has guided dozens of cloud service providers through the FedRAMP authorization process across all impact levels — Low, Moderate, and High. Our consultants bring direct experience working with the FedRAMP PMO, JAB reviewers, and federal agency authorizing officials.

### Why FedRAMP Matters

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is the standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services used by federal agencies. Without FedRAMP authorization, cloud service providers cannot sell to the federal government — a market worth over $100 billion annually.

### Our Approach

We take a phased, milestone-driven approach that minimizes disruption to your development teams while accelerating your path to authorization:

1. **Boundary Definition** — We work with your architects to define a clear, defensible authorization boundary that balances security requirements with business objectives.

2. **Control Implementation** — Our team maps your existing controls to NIST 800-53 requirements and identifies the most efficient path to full compliance.

3. **Documentation Excellence** — We produce assessment-ready documentation that passes 3PAO review the first time, eliminating costly revision cycles.

4. **Ongoing Partnership** — Post-authorization, we provide continuous monitoring support to maintain your ATO and respond to evolving requirements.

### Impact Levels We Support

- **FedRAMP Low** — For SaaS products handling low-impact data with 125+ controls
- **FedRAMP Moderate** — The most common level for federal cloud services with 325+ controls
- **FedRAMP High** — For systems processing highly sensitive data with 421+ controls
