## CMMC Certification Readiness

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is the Department of Defense's framework for verifying that defense contractors implement adequate cybersecurity practices to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Forge Cyber Defense helps organizations across the Defense Industrial Base achieve and maintain CMMC certification.

### Understanding CMMC Levels

- **Level 1 (Foundational)** — 17 practices focused on basic cyber hygiene for Federal Contract Information (FCI)
- **Level 2 (Advanced)** — 110 practices aligned with NIST SP 800-171 for organizations handling CUI
- **Level 3 (Expert)** — Enhanced requirements based on NIST SP 800-172 for critical programs

### Our CMMC Approach

We focus on practical, cost-effective implementations that protect CUI while minimizing operational disruption. Our team helps you scope your assessment boundary to include only what's necessary, reducing both implementation costs and assessment complexity.

### Beyond Certification

CMMC isn't just about passing an assessment — it's about building a sustainable cybersecurity program that protects sensitive defense information. We help you build processes that maintain compliance between assessments and adapt to evolving requirements.
