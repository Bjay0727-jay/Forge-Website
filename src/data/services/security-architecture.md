## Enterprise Security Architecture

Modern organizations need security architectures that protect sensitive data while enabling business agility. Forge Cyber Defense designs and implements security architectures that meet compliance requirements and defend against evolving threats.

### Zero Trust Principles

We design architectures based on zero trust principles aligned with Executive Order 14028 and NIST SP 800-207:

- **Never trust, always verify** — Every access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted
- **Least privilege access** — Users and systems receive minimum necessary permissions
- **Assume breach** — Design architectures that limit blast radius and enable rapid detection
- **Verify explicitly** — Continuous validation based on all available data points

### Cloud-Native Security

Our architects specialize in securing cloud environments across major providers:

- **AWS** — VPC design, Security Hub, GuardDuty, IAM policies, and GovCloud configurations
- **Azure** — Network security groups, Defender, Sentinel, and Azure Government
- **GCP** — VPC service controls, Security Command Center, and BeyondCorp

### Compliance-Ready by Design

Every architecture we design considers compliance requirements from the start. Whether you need FedRAMP, FISMA, CMMC, or HIPAA compliance, our architectures include the necessary controls and documentation touchpoints built in from day one.
