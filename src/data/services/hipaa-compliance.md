## Comprehensive HIPAA Security Compliance

HIPAA compliance is essential for healthcare organizations, health plans, and their business associates. Forge Cyber Defense provides practical, risk-based compliance services that protect patient data while supporting healthcare operations.

### The HIPAA Security Rule

The Security Rule establishes national standards for protecting electronic protected health information (ePHI). Our services cover all three categories of safeguards:

- **Administrative Safeguards** — Security management processes, workforce training, access management, and contingency planning
- **Physical Safeguards** — Facility access controls, workstation security, and device and media controls
- **Technical Safeguards** — Access controls, audit controls, integrity controls, and transmission security

### Risk-Based Approach

We follow the HHS Office for Civil Rights methodology for security risk assessments, ensuring your organization can demonstrate compliance during audits and investigations. Our assessments go beyond checkbox compliance to identify real risks to patient data.

### Business Associate Compliance

If you handle PHI on behalf of covered entities, you need a robust compliance program. We help business associates understand their obligations, implement appropriate safeguards, and maintain BAA compliance across their customer base.
