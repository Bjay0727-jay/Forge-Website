## SOC 2 Compliance Consulting

SOC 2 has become the gold standard for demonstrating security practices to enterprise customers. Whether you're pursuing your first Type I report or maintaining Type II compliance, Forge Cyber Defense provides the expertise to achieve your goals efficiently.

### Trust Services Criteria

SOC 2 audits evaluate your organization against five Trust Services Criteria:

1. **Security** (Required) — Protection against unauthorized access
2. **Availability** — System uptime and performance commitments
3. **Processing Integrity** — Accuracy and completeness of data processing
4. **Confidentiality** — Protection of confidential information
5. **Privacy** — Collection, use, and disposal of personal information

### Type I vs. Type II

- **Type I** — Point-in-time assessment of control design suitability
- **Type II** — Assessment of control operating effectiveness over a period (typically 6-12 months)

We help most organizations start with a Type I report to establish their baseline, then transition to Type II for ongoing compliance demonstration.

### Startup & Growth-Stage Focus

We understand that growing companies need SOC 2 to close enterprise deals but can't afford to slow down development. Our approach implements controls that integrate with modern development workflows — CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and agile processes.
