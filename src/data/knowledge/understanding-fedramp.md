## What is FedRAMP?

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. Established in 2011, FedRAMP has become the mandatory gateway for cloud service providers seeking to serve federal agencies.

## Why FedRAMP Matters

The federal cloud market represents over $100 billion in annual spending, and FedRAMP authorization is required for any cloud service provider wanting to participate. Beyond market access, FedRAMP demonstrates a rigorous commitment to security that resonates with commercial customers as well.

### Key Benefits

- **Federal Market Access** — Required for selling cloud services to any federal agency
- **Reusable Authorization** — Once authorized, your package can be reused by multiple agencies
- **Competitive Advantage** — Demonstrates security maturity to all customers
- **Standardized Framework** — Clear, predictable requirements based on NIST standards

## FedRAMP Impact Levels

FedRAMP defines three impact levels based on the potential impact of a security breach:

### Low Impact

Suitable for systems where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would have limited adverse effects. Requires implementation of approximately 125 security controls.

### Moderate Impact

The most common level, covering systems where a breach could have serious adverse effects. Requires approximately 325 security controls. Most federal SaaS solutions target this level.

### High Impact

For systems processing highly sensitive data where a breach could have severe or catastrophic effects. Requires approximately 421 security controls. Typically reserved for law enforcement, healthcare, and financial systems.

## The Authorization Process

### 1. Readiness Assessment

Before beginning the formal authorization process, conduct a thorough readiness assessment to understand your current security posture and identify gaps against FedRAMP requirements.

### 2. Preparation Phase

Develop your System Security Plan (SSP), implement required controls, and prepare all supporting documentation. This phase typically takes 3-6 months depending on your starting maturity.

### 3. Assessment Phase

Engage a FedRAMP-accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) to conduct an independent security assessment of your system. The 3PAO produces a Security Assessment Report (SAR).

### 4. Authorization Phase

Submit your complete authorization package for review. This can be done through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) path or through an individual agency sponsor.

### 5. Continuous Monitoring

After receiving your Authority to Operate (ATO), you must maintain ongoing compliance through monthly vulnerability scanning, annual assessments, and regular reporting.

## Common Challenges

- **Scope Creep** — Poorly defined system boundaries lead to unnecessary control implementations
- **Documentation Burden** — FedRAMP requires extensive, detailed documentation
- **3PAO Findings** — Inadequate preparation leads to costly assessment cycles
- **Resource Requirements** — Underestimating the people, time, and tools needed
