## What is StateRAMP?

StateRAMP (State Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a nonprofit membership organization that provides a standardized approach for state and local governments to verify the cybersecurity posture of cloud solutions. Modeled after the federal FedRAMP program, StateRAMP enables state and local government entities to make informed, risk-based decisions about cloud service adoption.

Founded in 2020, StateRAMP emerged from the recognition that state and local governments faced many of the same cloud security challenges as federal agencies but lacked a unified framework for evaluating cloud service provider security. Rather than each state developing its own assessment methodology, StateRAMP provides a common standard that reduces duplication of effort for both governments and cloud providers.

## Why StateRAMP Matters for Cloud Providers

The state and local government market represents a significant opportunity for cloud service providers. Combined state and local IT spending exceeds $100 billion annually, with cloud services representing an increasing share of that budget. StateRAMP authorization provides several strategic advantages:

### Market Access

A growing number of state procurement processes require or prefer StateRAMP authorization. States that have formally adopted or are evaluating StateRAMP standards include Arizona, California, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and many others. StateRAMP authorization positions your organization to compete effectively for these contracts.

### Reusable Authorization

Like FedRAMP, StateRAMP authorization is designed to be reusable. Once authorized, your security package can be leveraged by multiple state and local government customers, reducing the time and cost of security reviews for each new engagement.

### FedRAMP Alignment

StateRAMP leverages FedRAMP baselines and assessment methodologies where applicable. This alignment means that organizations pursuing both federal and state markets can achieve significant efficiency by coordinating their compliance efforts.

### Competitive Differentiation

StateRAMP authorization demonstrates a serious commitment to security that resonates with government procurement officials. In competitive situations, authorization can be the deciding factor.

## StateRAMP Security Categories

StateRAMP defines four security categories that correspond to different levels of risk and required security controls:

### Category 1 — Low Sensitivity

Category 1 applies to cloud services that process, store, or transmit low-sensitivity data where a security breach would have minimal impact on government operations or individuals.

**Control Requirements**: Approximately 125 security controls based on FedRAMP Low baseline
**Typical Timeline**: 3-6 months
**Examples**: Public-facing websites, general productivity tools, non-sensitive collaboration platforms

### Category 2 — Moderate Sensitivity

Category 2 covers cloud services handling data where a breach would have a moderate impact on government operations, assets, or individuals. This is the most commonly sought category.

**Control Requirements**: Approximately 325 security controls based on FedRAMP Moderate baseline
**Typical Timeline**: 6-12 months
**Examples**: Systems processing PII, financial data, or other sensitive but unclassified information

### Category 3 — High Sensitivity

Category 3 applies to cloud services where a security breach could have severe or catastrophic consequences for government operations or individuals.

**Control Requirements**: Approximately 421 security controls based on FedRAMP High baseline
**Typical Timeline**: 12-18 months
**Examples**: Criminal justice systems, critical infrastructure, highly sensitive personal data

### LI-SaaS (Low Impact SaaS)

LI-SaaS is a streamlined category for low-risk SaaS solutions that meet specific criteria, including limited data sensitivity and straightforward architectures.

**Control Requirements**: Reduced control set focused on most critical security areas
**Typical Timeline**: 2-4 months
**Examples**: Simple SaaS tools without sensitive data processing

## StateRAMP vs. FedRAMP: Key Differences

While StateRAMP is modeled after FedRAMP, several important differences exist:

### Target Market
- **FedRAMP**: Federal agencies
- **StateRAMP**: State and local governments

### Governance
- **FedRAMP**: Government-run program managed by GSA
- **StateRAMP**: Nonprofit organization with government and industry participation

### Authorization Acceptance
- **FedRAMP**: Mandatory for federal cloud services; reciprocity across all agencies
- **StateRAMP**: Voluntary adoption by states; growing but not universal acceptance

### Assessment Requirements
- **FedRAMP**: Requires assessment by FedRAMP-recognized Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)
- **StateRAMP**: Requires assessment by StateRAMP-approved assessor

### Cost Structure
- **FedRAMP**: Assessment costs plus federal review fees
- **StateRAMP**: Assessment costs plus membership fees; generally lower overall cost than FedRAMP

## The StateRAMP Authorization Process

### Step 1: Membership and Preparation

Organizations begin by joining StateRAMP as a service provider member. This provides access to program resources, templates, and guidance. During preparation:

- Determine the appropriate security category for your service
- Conduct an internal readiness assessment
- Identify gaps and develop a remediation plan
- Select a StateRAMP-approved Third Party Assessor Organization (3PAO)

### Step 2: Documentation Development

Create the required documentation package:

- **System Security Plan (SSP)**: Comprehensive description of your system architecture, boundaries, and security control implementations
- **Policies and Procedures**: Documentation supporting security control implementation
- **Configuration Guides**: System hardening and configuration standards
- **Incident Response Plan**: Procedures for detecting and responding to security incidents
- **Contingency Plan**: Business continuity and disaster recovery documentation

### Step 3: Third-Party Assessment

Your selected 3PAO conducts an independent assessment of your security controls:

- **Documentation Review**: Assessment of SSP and supporting documentation
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scanning and testing of system components
- **Penetration Testing**: Attempted exploitation of identified vulnerabilities
- **Control Interviews**: Discussions with personnel responsible for security controls
- **Control Testing**: Verification that controls operate as documented

### Step 4: Remediation

Address findings from the assessment:

- Remediate high and critical vulnerabilities
- Update documentation to reflect actual implementations
- Develop Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) for items requiring additional time

### Step 5: Authorization Review

Submit your authorization package to StateRAMP:

- System Security Plan
- Security Assessment Report from 3PAO
- Plan of Action and Milestones
- Continuous Monitoring documentation

StateRAMP reviews the package and makes an authorization determination.

### Step 6: Continuous Monitoring

Maintain your authorization through ongoing monitoring:

- Monthly vulnerability scanning and reporting
- Annual security control assessments
- Significant change reporting
- Incident notification
- Annual authorization renewal

## Texas Risk and Authorization Management Program (TX-RAMP)

Texas deserves special mention as it has developed its own program, TX-RAMP, for cloud services used by state agencies. TX-RAMP aligns closely with StateRAMP and FedRAMP but has Texas-specific requirements.

### TX-RAMP Levels

- **Level 1**: Basic security requirements for low-risk services
- **Level 2**: Enhanced requirements aligned with FedRAMP Moderate

### TX-RAMP and StateRAMP Relationship

Texas accepts StateRAMP authorizations as evidence of security posture and may issue TX-RAMP certification more quickly to StateRAMP-authorized providers. Organizations serving Texas should consider pursuing both authorizations.

## Preparing for StateRAMP Success

Based on our experience helping organizations achieve StateRAMP authorization, we recommend:

### Start with a Gap Assessment

Before investing in full documentation and assessment, conduct a thorough gap assessment against your target security category. This identifies remediation requirements and helps build realistic timelines and budgets.

### Leverage Existing Compliance Work

If you hold FedRAMP authorization, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, or other relevant certifications, significant portions of your existing documentation and evidence can be leveraged for StateRAMP.

### Invest in Automation

Continuous monitoring requirements are ongoing obligations. Investing in automated vulnerability scanning, configuration management, and compliance monitoring tools reduces long-term operational burden.

### Choose Your Assessor Carefully

Your 3PAO relationship extends beyond initial assessment to ongoing monitoring and annual reassessment. Select an assessor with relevant experience and a collaborative approach.

### Plan for Continuous Monitoring

Authorization is not the end—it's the beginning of an ongoing compliance program. Budget and plan for monthly monitoring activities, annual assessments, and the operational overhead of maintaining authorization.

## Conclusion

StateRAMP authorization opens the door to the substantial state and local government cloud market while demonstrating a commitment to security that resonates with government customers. While the authorization process requires significant investment, the reusable nature of authorization and alignment with FedRAMP make it an efficient path to serving government customers at all levels.

Organizations already pursuing or holding FedRAMP authorization should strongly consider StateRAMP as a natural extension of their compliance program. Those focused primarily on state and local markets may find StateRAMP a more direct and cost-effective path than federal authorization.
