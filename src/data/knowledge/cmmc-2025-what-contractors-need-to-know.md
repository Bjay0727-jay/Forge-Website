## The State of CMMC

The Department of Defense's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program continues to evolve as the DoD works to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) across the defense industrial base. With the final rule now published, defense contractors must prepare for mandatory third-party assessments.

## Key Changes from CMMC 1.0 to 2.0

The CMMC framework was streamlined significantly in its 2.0 revision:

- **Reduced from 5 levels to 3** — Simplified maturity levels that align directly with existing standards
- **Eliminated unique practices** — CMMC 2.0 maps directly to NIST SP 800-171 and 800-172
- **Introduced self-assessment** — Level 1 allows self-assessment, reducing costs for small contractors
- **POA&M allowances** — Limited use of Plans of Action & Milestones for certain requirements

## Understanding the Three Levels

### Level 1: Foundational

- **Who needs it**: Contractors handling Federal Contract Information (FCI) only
- **Requirements**: 17 basic practices from FAR 52.204-21
- **Assessment**: Annual self-assessment with senior official affirmation
- **Timeline**: Required in applicable contracts now

### Level 2: Advanced

- **Who needs it**: Contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- **Requirements**: 110 security requirements from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2
- **Assessment**: Third-party assessment by C3PAO (for prioritized acquisitions) or self-assessment
- **Timeline**: Being phased into contracts starting 2025

### Level 3: Expert

- **Who needs it**: Contractors on highest-priority programs
- **Requirements**: NIST SP 800-172 enhanced security requirements
- **Assessment**: Government-led assessment by DIBCAC
- **Timeline**: Later phase of implementation

## Preparing Your Organization

### Step 1: Determine Your Required Level

Review your current and anticipated DoD contracts to determine what type of information you handle (FCI vs. CUI) and what CMMC level will be required.

### Step 2: Scope Your Environment

Identify where CUI is processed, stored, and transmitted. Minimizing your CUI boundary reduces the scope and cost of your CMMC assessment.

### Step 3: Assess Current Gaps

Compare your existing security practices against the required NIST SP 800-171 controls. A professional gap assessment provides a clear remediation roadmap.

### Step 4: Remediate and Document

Implement missing controls, update policies and procedures, and build your System Security Plan. Documentation is critical — if it's not documented, it doesn't exist.

### Step 5: Prepare for Assessment

Conduct a mock assessment, gather evidence for all controls, and ensure your team understands the assessment process.

## Don't Wait

CMMC requirements are appearing in new DoD contracts. Organizations that begin preparing now will have a competitive advantage over those scrambling to comply at the last minute.
